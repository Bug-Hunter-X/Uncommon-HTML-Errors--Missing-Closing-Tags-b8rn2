<p>The corrected code addresses the missing closing tags:</p><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;This is some text.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" /&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>Notice the self-closing tag for <code>img</code>, though it's not strictly required in HTML5, its use is encouraged for clarity.</p><pre><code>&lt;div id="myDiv"&gt;This is some text.&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>The outer div now has its closing tag.  Always make sure opening tags are paired with closing tags, ensuring proper nesting and structure.  This enhances the code's readability and prevents potential rendering problems.</p>
