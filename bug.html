<p>This is a common error in HTML, but it can be difficult to spot:</p><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;This is some text.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Image"&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>In this code, the <code>img</code> tag is missing the closing <code>&lt;/img&gt;</code> tag.  While browsers often handle this gracefully, it's bad practice and can lead to unpredictable layout issues, especially if you're using CSS or JavaScript to manipulate the elements.</p><p>Another less common, but equally problematic error:</p><pre><code>&lt;div id="myDiv"&gt;This is some text.&lt;div&gt;</code></pre><p>This creates a nested div without a closing tag for the outer <code>div</code>. The browser may attempt to close the outer div automatically, but this can lead to unexpected behavior. Always make sure every opening tag has a corresponding closing tag.</p>
